### 💡 What I learned

The main challenge was the title font size: the design suggested 22px, but this caused the text to wrap into 3 lines instead of 2. I reduced it to 20px to keep the layout consistent.

```css
.card__title {
  /* Adjusted to maintain design integrity */
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### 🔮 Continued development

I want to focus on typography handling and responsive adjustments for better scalability in future projects.
