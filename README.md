## Overview

Recreated a QR code component from a Figma design using only HTML and CSS, focusing on proper structure, clean styling, and responsive centering.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Just clone and open `index.html` in your browser.

## âœ¨ Features

- Simple, clean HTML & CSS structure
- Centralized card layout
- Custom properties for colors and spacing

### âœ… Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS with variables
- BEM methodology
- Flexbox for layout

### ðŸ’¡ What I learned

The main challenge was the title font size: the design suggested 22px, but this caused the text to wrap into 3 lines instead of 2. I reduced it to 20px to keep the layout consistent.

```css
.card__title {
  /* Adjusted to maintain design integrity */
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### ðŸ”® Continued development

I want to focus on typography handling and responsive adjustments for better scalability in future projects.
